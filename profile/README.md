## Welcome to the Caves Lab
Research in the Caves lab lies at the intersection of behavioral ecology, animal vision, and evolution. 
Although much of our research focuses on marine cleaning interactions, 
our research uses a variety of systems to ask questions regarding how organisms perceive their visual world, 
and how that perception influences both signals and behaviors, with a focus on how animals perceive, recognize, and interact with other individuals.
